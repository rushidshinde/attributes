# üìÇ Accordion Component ‚Äì Attribute-Based Setup

This accordion system is designed to work purely using **custom HTML attributes**, with styling handled via CSS and behavior toggled through JavaScript. It's lightweight, semantic, and framework-free.

---

## üìê How It Works

You define your accordion structure using a set of `rs-accordion-element` attributes, and control initial state and behavior with optional attributes like `rs-accordian-initial` and `rs-accordian-single`.

The JavaScript handles toggling by simply adding or removing the class `is-active-accordian` to relevant elements. All animations, visual cues, and transitions are done in CSS.
